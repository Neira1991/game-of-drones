# GAME OF DRONES
This is a code to game like "How-are-you? Speak!"

### FIRST (Clone :smile:)
`git clone https://github.com/fortil/game-of-drones.git`

`cd game-of-drones`

### SERVER SIDE
`cd server`

`yarn install` or `npm i` (I prefer `yarn`)

`yarn start` or `npm start`

It will run on the port `8080` (localhost)

### CLIENT SIDE

`cd cliente`

`yarn install` or `npm i` (I prefer `yarn`)

`yarn start` or `npm start`

The navigator will open a tab on `localhost:3000`

Enjoy!
